This guide provides information about NIC Teaming and Switch Embedded Teaming (SET) in Windows Server 2016. NIC Teaming allows you to group between one and thirty-two physical Ethernet network adapters into one or more software-based virtual network adapters. These virtual network adapters provide fast performance and fault tolerance in the event of a network adapter failure. You can use this guide to learn the differences between NIC Teaming and Switch Embedded Teaming, to learn how to create, manage, update, and delete teams, and to use switch dependent or switch independent teaming with different algorithms that will work best for your deployment. In addition the differences between NIC Teaming versions in different operating systems since Windows Server 2012 are explained.
